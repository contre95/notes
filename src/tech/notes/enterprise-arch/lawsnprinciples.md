## Peter Lawrence Principle
[read more..](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle)

```
People in a hierarchy tend to rise to "a level of respective incompetence": 
Employees are promoted based on their success in previous jobs until they reach a 
level at which they are no longer competent, as skills in one job do not 
necessarily translate to another.
```

The concept was explained in the 1969 book The Peter Principle (William Morrow and Company) by Peter and Raymond Hull. (Hull wrote the text, based on Peter's research.) Peter and Hull intended the book to be satire,[3] but it became popular as it was seen to make a serious point about the shortcomings of how people are promoted within hierarchical organizations. The Peter Principle has since been the subject of much commentary and research.
